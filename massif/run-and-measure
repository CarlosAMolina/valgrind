# Options:
# --time-unit=B specify that we want the time unit to instead be the number of bytes allocated/deallocated on the heap and stack(s).
# --stacks=yes option: measure the size of the stack(s). By default, stack profiling is off as it slows Massif down greatly.
# --massif-out-file: file with Massif's profiling data.
# --pages-as-heap=yes: tells Massif to profile memory at the page level rather than at the malloc'd block level.
#   By default, Massif measures only higher-level malloc calls, Massif does not measure:
#   - The lower-level system calls that a program may use to allocate memory.
#   - The size of code, data and BSS segments.
#   Therefore, the numbers reported by Massif may be significantly smaller than those reported by tools such as top that measure a program's total size in memory.
#   The allocation functions measured by default by Massif are built on top of these system calls. For example, when needed, an allocator will typically call mmap to allocate a large chunk of memory, and then hand over pieces of that memory chunk to the client program in response to calls to malloc et al.
#   You can use the --pages-as-heap=yes to measure it, even the stack is measured; for this reason --stacks=yes is not allowed in conjunction with --pages-as-heap=yes.
